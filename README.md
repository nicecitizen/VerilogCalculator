Verilog code for an FPGA calculator from the summer semester's EE Production Practice assignment. It runs on the STEP FPGA (Intel MAX10) core board, with part of the IOs (32 in total) connected to a designated PCB board. The calculator implements simple logic but can perform operations practically. The top module is Calculator.v, where the math operations are defined. Two functional blocks, Keyboard.v and SegDisplay.v, handle the IO realization of the calculator, each recalling other submodules to fulfill their respective duties.
