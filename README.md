Despite acheiving required functions, the verilog-designed digital circuit itself is not correctly implemented. This is because it's writen by a verilog newbie (me by one year earlier), using C programming style to verilog coding, that's a common mistake for verilog beginners. So the utilization of HW is extremely high due to wrongfully use combinational expression in sequential logic which leads to inferring latches and so on... 
If you're interested in how to implement a verilog calculator and your FPGA board's resources is enough, this may be a reference implementation, but DO NOT REFERENCE THIS WRONG VERILOG PRACTICE! I'll update some other correct designs in other repos and this repo is archived for beforementioned reasons. 

<del>Verilog code for an FPGA calculator from the summer semester's EE Production Practice assignment. It runs on the STEP FPGA (Intel MAX10) core board, with part of the IOs (32 in total) connected to a designated PCB board. The calculator implements simple logic but can perform operations practically. The top module is Calculator.v, where the math operations are defined. Two functional blocks, Keyboard.v and SegDisplay.v, handle the IO realization of the calculator, each recalling other submodules to fulfill their respective duties.</del>
