Verilog code of a FPGA calculator from the assignment of summer semester's EE Production Practice . 
Running on STEP FPGA's (Intel-MAX10) core board and part of the IOs (total is 32) are connected to a designated PCB board.
The code's logic is simple but as a beginer , really give no importance to the timing analysis , 
the calculator could perform four basic arthemetic operations and some demo functions.
